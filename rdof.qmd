We had some previous works on RDOF for BCAT. It used shapefiles and gpkg to produce the output. This was not needed anymore as we could relly on census boundary (with less topological error) and just use the spreadsheet profided (`.xls`). 

If we were about to change our workflow it was a good opportunity to test the end results. 

The R script used for that can be find in the doc section of [data-bead-etl repo](https://github.com/ruralinnovation/data-BEAD-ETL/tree/main/doc).

Here I will summarize some of the key results and dive a bit more on the trouble we ran into. 

## Key results:

- We do not have any difference between our previous pipeline and the new one for "Authorized RDOF"

- In 2024 they are no difference in "ready to authorized" to "authorized": everything was authorized. 

- We also verified that RDOF data is matching to a Census block 2010 geoid. 

- We have data issue between "default": ie we have two contradictory data sources. 


## Two data sources:

Our previous works was on a release from the end of 2022 (`16dec2022` according to the file name) and the new one end of 2023 (`2023-12-20` according to the file name).

The version of 2022 have 266 994 and  286 892 for 2023. Our first thought was that it makes sense to have nore "default" as time go but some cases of default in 2022 are missing in 2023 (is it possible for a default RDOF to be not defaulted?). 

 48 121 rows are only present in 2022 (they are the potentially weirds one). 68 019 rows are only present in 2023 version. Finally, 218873 are identics.  

### Other small "hiccups"

We have some cases that were defaulted but still are present in authorized.: 47 cases, all in Wisconsin (County: 55043) and same company. 

They will be removed from Authorized.
