We had some previous works on RDOF for BCAT. It used shapefiles and gpkg to produce the output. This was not needed anymore as we could relly on census boundary (with less topological error). 

If we were about to change our workflow it was a good opportunity to test the end results. 

The R script used for that can be find in the doc section of [data-bead-etl repo](https://github.com/ruralinnovation/data-BEAD-ETL/tree/main/doc).

Here I will summarize some of the key results and dive a bit more on the trouble we ran into. 

## Key results:

- We do not have any difference between our previous pipeline and the new one for "Authorized RDOF"

- In 2024 they are no difference in "ready to authorized" to "authorized": everything was authorized. 

- We have data issue between "default": ie we have two contracditory data sources.
