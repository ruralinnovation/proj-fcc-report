We are using two sources of data from FCC: 

- National Broadband Map ([NBM](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home))  

- Broadband Funding Map ([BFM](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/home))


Their license can be found [here](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/about):

## What are those two?

The first one was started by FCC in November 2022[^fcc_nbm_start] while the second was first published in May 2023[^bfn_da_links].

The first is providing information at the scale of a "service": a location covered by a provider by a technology with specifics speeds.  

::: {.callout-tip}
A location (see @sec-BSL) can be covered by multiple Internet Services Provides (ISP) with maybe differents services and technologies. 
:::

We are using the "Broadband availability" dataset (see @fig-broadbanddata, below) that come from the "Fabric locations" (developped by CostQuest) and is providing the basis of the National Broadband Map. The locations are determined within the Fabric Locations data. The exact coordinates of every locations is only part of the Fabric data and within the Broadband availability we can only link a locations thanks to field specifying in which Census Block (2020 vintage) they are present. 
 
The second (BFM) is providing informations about "*broadband infrastructure deployment projects funded by the Federal government throughout the United States*". The information is provided either at the scale of a specific project inside a program or for the whole program. Hence we have some caracteristics of each projects with their associated boundaries (territories covered) (TODO link fcc funding list).

### What is a Broadband Service Location (BSL)? {#sec-BSL}

> A broadband serviceable location is defined as “a business or residential location in the United States at which fixed broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.”  A residential BSL includes all residential structures, including structures that are (or contain) housing units or group quarters (as those terms are defined by the United States Census Bureau).  A business BSL includes “all non-residential (business, government, non-profit, etc.) structures that are on property without residential locations and that would expect to demand Internet access service.” (source FCC[^fcc_bsl])
