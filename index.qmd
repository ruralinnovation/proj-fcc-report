We are using two sources of data from FCC: 

- [National Broadband Map (NBM)](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home): our source for speeds by census block  

- [Broadband Funding Map (BFM)](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/home)

What are those two?

How regurarly is it updated? 

What is BSL? 

What is unserved? Underseved? (BSL / block area) 

Granularity: what is a "row" / why do we need to do a block "join"  

What are we using (NBM , BFM) for ? 

Our products: 

- CH. BEAD, regular BB works, research, (TED/ERC ?) <- too specific
