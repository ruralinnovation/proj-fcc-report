At the Center on Rural Innovation, we use two types of data sourced directly from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission):

- National Broadband Map ([NBM](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home){.external target="_blank"}) which is the product of the [Broadband Data Collection initiative](https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData){.external target="_blank"}

- Broadband Funding Map ([BFM](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/home){.external target="_blank"})

#### FCC Broadband Data Collection license and attribution

Licensing for Broadband Data Collection data can be found [here](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/about){.external target="_blank"} and [here](https://fundingmap.fcc.gov/about){.external target="_blank"} and to summarize, the FCC asks that minimal attribution for each of the above datasets is provided in the form:

>
>     Source data: FCC Broadband Data Collection
>     Map layer based on FCC BDC
>
>     Source data: FCC Broadband Funding Map
>     Map layer based on FCC BFM
>

The licenses contain an additional addendum about CostQuest, the third-party that produces and essential input to these datasets, the location Fabric:

>
> CostQuest Associates, Inc. and its third-party licensors, as applicable, own all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the data for locations reflected in the Fabric (including the Location ID, latitude and longitude, address, unit count, and building type code for each location in the Fabric). CostQuest is granted certain rights to Fabric correction submissions for the purpose of correcting or otherwise modifying BDC Fabric data. Broadband service providers, governmental entities, and other third parties are able to license Fabric data, including any changes to Fabric data that have been made as a result of challenges, at no cost for purposes of their participation in the FCC's Broadband Data Collection.

#### What are these two datasets?

The first one (NBM) was started by the FCC in November 2022[^fcc_nbm_start] while the second was first published in May 2023[^bfn_da_links] (and documentation[^bfm_doc] in July 2023).

[^fcc_nbm_start]: [https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2022/11/18/new-broadband-maps-are-finally-here](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2022/11/18/new-broadband-maps-are-finally-here)

[^bfm_doc]: See Changelog [https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bfm-data-downloads-output](https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bfm-data-downloads-output)

The NBM provides information at the scale of a "service" - a location covered by a provider of a technology with specifics maximum download and upload speeds.

Every location is characterized by:

  - Who is providing those services (`frn`, `provider_id`, and `brand_name`)
  - A description of each services (`technology`, `max_advertised_download_speed`, `max_advertised_upload_speed`, `low_latency`)
  - Whether the location associated with residential, business or both
  - ways to localize it (`state_abbr`, `block_geoid`, `h3_res8_id`)

::: {.callout-tip}
A location (see @sec-BSL) can be covered by multiple Internet Services Providers (ISP) with  potentially different services and technologies. Hence, a single location can be represented in the data can by multiple "rows".
:::

Behind the National Broadband Map they are **two** datasets (see @fig-broadbanddata, below). We are using the "Broadband Availability" dataset, which is derived from the "Fabric" locations dataset (developed by CostQuest), but the latter is only accessible to parties who enter into a special license agreement with CostQuest. The primary difference between the two data sets is that the "Fabric" data assigns a specific geospatial coordinate to every location, which is intentionally "stripped" out the "Broadband Availability" data set. However, each location has a serial identifier that is (presumably) shared between the two data sets.

:::{.aside}
The program/process for collecting broadband service information as reported by all ISP's operating within the United States is called **B**roadband **D**ata **C**ollection (BDC).
:::

The exact coordinates of every location is only part of the Fabric dataset and within the Broadband Availability we can only link a record for a location to a Census Block (2020 vintage) identifier or a H3 (hexagon) grid location.

The BFM provides information about "*broadband infrastructure deployment projects funded by the Federal government throughout the United States*". The information is structured either at the scale of a specific project inside a program or for the whole program. Hence we have characteristics of each projects with their associated boundaries (territories covered) (see link [https://ruralinnovation.github.io/proj-fcc-report/fcc_funding.html](https://ruralinnovation.github.io/proj-fcc-report/fcc_funding.html)).


#### What is a Broadband Service Location (BSL)? {#sec-BSL}

> A broadband serviceable location is defined as “a business or residential location in the United States at which fixed broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.”  A residential BSL includes all residential structures, including structures that are (or contain) housing units or group quarters (as those terms are defined by the United States Census Bureau).  A business BSL includes “all non-residential (business, government, non-profit, etc.) structures that are on property without residential locations and that would expect to demand Internet access service.” (source FCC[^fcc_bsl])

[^fcc_bsl]: ["The Fabric data"](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/7412732399003-Fabric-FAQs)

#### When is this data updated?

NBM has two big releases per year (June and December) and have "unofficial" versions every two weeks to take into account challenges[^challenges]. 
Experience has told us that sometimes their release can be faster (more than one per week) or slower.
The FCC did not (April 2024) provides a changelog between releases or versions (but the documentation has some of the major changes[^nbm_chnagelog]). 

[^challenges]: [https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/bdc-challenge-overview.pdf](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/bdc-challenge-overview.pdf)

[^nbm_chnagelog]:See "Change Log" [https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output](https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output)

BFM seems to follow a schedule of update every two weeks but we have not find any specifications. 

#### What is the geographic coverage of those datasets?

The Broadband Availability data is covering all US States, Puerto Rico and the US territories.  

The coverage of the funding map depend on each specific program. 

#### What is unserved v.s. underseved?

Served, Unserved and Underseved are **overlapping** categories at the **location level**. They can be extended at the "**area level**".

If all available internet services at a location have advertised (reported) maximum speeds that are below 25 Mbps downstream speed or below 3 Mbps upstream (25/3 to simplify), then that location is categorized as **unserved**. If a location has at least one service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 25/3, but no service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 100/20, it is categorized as **underserved**. If a location has at least one service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 100/20, then that location is categorized as **served**.

Those definitions are recommended in the [FCC's Broadband Speed Benchmark](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark) and can be adapted by every States[^pew_list].

<!--
:::{.aside}
FCC could change those definitions and for example move the bar at 100/20: [https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark)

### Quick facts, May 2024:

#### Broadband Availibility: 

- Number of BSL: 115 342 225

- Number of unique `FRN`: 2879 

#### Funding Map:

- 4 agencies are contributing

- The Funding Map consist of 12 programs (1853 projects) with two specific to Puerto Rico (PR) and US territories. 

- Those projects are classified by FCC in 3 categories: "Area", "List of locations" and "Midle mile"[^midle_mile]

[^midle_mile]: In May 2024 no "Midle mile" were present
