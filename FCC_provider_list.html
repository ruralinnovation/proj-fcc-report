<p>We can confirm that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>FRN</code> here is unique for every row in this data set (our primary key)</p></li>
<li><p>We have a bit less <code>Provider.Name</code> (4321 / 4341) than <code>FRN</code></p></li>
<li><p>We have the same number of <code>Affiliations</code> and <code>Provider.ID</code></p></li>
<li><p>The number of <code>Provider.ID</code>/<code>Affiliations</code> is smaller than FRN.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A quick check indicate that all <code>Provider.ID</code> are 6 characters. <code>FRN</code> is also always 10 characters.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="margin-aside">
<p>Hence the one with 7 characters in FCC NBM is probably an error.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-provider-name-that-are-sharing-multiple-frn">What are the Provider Name that are sharing multiple <code>FRN</code>:</h3>
<p>We probably have cases where companies have same name (“Farmers Mutual Telephone company”) but we have probably company that have multiple FRN (“Grand Mound Cooperative Telephone Association”). Granted the low numbers I think we are fair to assume it does not matter to much.</p>
