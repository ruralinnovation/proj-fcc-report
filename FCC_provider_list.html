<p>It seems <code>Affiliation</code> has the same number than <code>Provider.ID</code>.</p>
<p><code>Provider.ID</code> is close but a bit less number than <code>FRN</code> which seems to be the “primary key” of this table.</p>
<p>A quick check indicate that all <code>Provider.ID</code> are 6 characters (hence the one with 7 in FCC NBM is probably an error). <code>FRN</code> is also always 10 characters.</p>
