US Department of Treasury,18,Capital Projects Fund,2021-03-11,"For a capital project to be an eligible use of Capital Projects Fund grant funds, it must meet all of the following criteria: The capital project invests in capital assets designed to directly enable work, education, and health monitoring. The capital project is designed to address a critical need that resulted from or was made apparent or exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health emergency. The capital project is designed to address a critical need of the community to be served by it.   The following capital projects are identified in the Capital Projects Fund Guidance as being eligible uses of Capital Projects Fund grant funding: Broadband Infrastructure Projects: the construction and deployment of broadband infrastructure designed to deliver service that reliably meets or exceeds symmetrical speeds of 100Mbps so that communities have future-proof infrastructure to serve their long-term needs. Digital Connectivity Technology Projects: the purchase or installation of devices and equipment, such as laptops, tablets, desktop personal computers, and public Wi-Fi equipment, to facilitate broadband internet access for communities where affordability is a barrier to broadband adoption and use. Multi-Purpose Community Facility Projects: the construction or improvement of buildings designed to jointly and directly enable work, education, and health monitoring located in communities with critical need for the project. Case-by-Case Review: In addition to the eligible Capital Projects identified above, recipients may propose a different use of funds.  Such uses must meet the statutory criteria, and recipients will be required to demonstrate that any such projects satisfy the eligibility criteria identified in the Capital Projects Fund Guidance. Capital Projects Fund grant funding can also be used for the ancillary costs related to eligible capital projects that are necessary to put the asset to full use.
